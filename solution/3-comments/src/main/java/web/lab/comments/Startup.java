                    **Wow, this new Quarkus update is incredible!** 
                    
                    The performance improvements are exactly what I needed for my current project. 
                    The integration with Kubernetes is seamless and saves so much time. 
                                        
                    Kudos to the team for this fantastic release! ðŸŽ‰

                    While I appreciate the new features, especially the improved memory usage, I feel like the **documentation could be better**.
                    
                    Some parts are quite vague and require a lot of trial and error to understand.
